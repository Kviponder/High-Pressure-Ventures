The weather dashboard is a dynamic web application that displays current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. Users can search for a city and view its weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a 5-day forecast. The application uses the 5 Day Weather Forecast API and stores persistent data with localStorage.
